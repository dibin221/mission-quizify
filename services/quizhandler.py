        Steps:
            1. Initialize an empty list to store the unique quiz questions.
            2. Loop through the desired number of questions (`num_questions`), generating each question via `generate_question_with_vectorstore`.

        Task: Initialize the QuizManager class with a list of quiz questions.

        Overview:
        This task involves setting up the `QuizManager` class by initializing it with a list of quiz question objects. Each quiz question object is a dictionary that includes the question text, multiple choice options, the correct answer, and an explanation. The initialization process should prepare the class for managing these quiz questions, including tracking the total number of questions.

        Instructions:
        1. Store the provided list of quiz question objects in an instance variable named `questions`.
        2. Calculate and store the total number of questions in the list in an instance variable named `total_questions`.

        Parameters:
        - questions: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a quiz question along with its choices, correct answer, and an explanation.

        Note: This initialization method is crucial for setting the foundation of the `QuizManager` class, enabling it to manage the quiz questions effectively. The class will rely on this setup to perform operations such as retrieving specific questions by index and navigating through the quiz.

This method should account for wrapping, meaning if advancing past the last question or moving before the first question, it should continue from the opposite end.
